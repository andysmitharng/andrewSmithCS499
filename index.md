### Self-Assesment
```
I have learned a lot as I worked through my Computer Science program. Some of my education came from course work, some of it came 
   
from working on  my own projects. When I first decided to major in Computer Science, I wasn’t really sure what I ultimately wanted 
   
to do. As I started to develop basic programs, work with databases, and create application on both the back and front end, I was 
   
able to develop an idea of my strengths, weaknesses, and interest. I found that using creative problem solving, through the backend 
   
development of applications, was what I enjoyed the most. Having spent most of my adult life in the military, adding in a team 
   
environment really allowed me to excel. By working with others, both in class and outside of it, I was able to increase my skill set 
   
in software design, databases, algorithms, and security. This all really came together while working with Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
   
I started a project with my brother that incorporated multiple AWS services, it required me to use Python to populate a relational 
   
database with information from user file uploads. The function was secured using AWS’s group permissions and security best 
   
practices. I was able to collaborate with another developer, utilizing all of the skills I had learned in my degree program, and 
   
create a secure solution to a problem.   
    
I have chosen 2 artifacts to represent my work in software design, databases, and algorithms. The first artifact is an Android 

application designed to allow a user to search for campgrounds based on name, city, or feature. They can also use location services to 

find camps near their location. The application has a user login that is secured using an MD5 hash and then it is securely stored on the 

company database. It also uses SQLite to store and query user data and campground information. Location services are only accessed with 

user permissions and there is social media integration through the ability to post campground experiences on Facebook. The second 

artifact is a program that loads in a file containing eBay bids run by a local government. The program allows a user to search the bids 

in order to do an audit. They can search by government department or by a specific bid. All of the data for each bid is stored in a 

binary search tree to make searching as fast as possible. The search tree uses nodes to store information and point to the next node.
